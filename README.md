# The Green Square Wizard

The solution to your GitHub profile crisis. Do you keep forgetting to make a commit daily to fill up the green squares on your profile? Let the wizard do the job. Be sure to leave a ðŸŒŸ.

## About

My 11th grade year in high school has now started for me, and with having to keep up with classes, I found it difficult at times to remember to commit something random to get a green square on my profile. So, like any good developer would do, I programmed a simple github bot to take care of my issue. The wizard will "Strike" or make a commit to this repository every 12 hours. This is to prevent a full 24 hours from going by and potentially missing the time. For instance if you had bad internet at one point in time and the commit is made a few seconds later than 24 hours.

## Developer Info

The program itself is ran by a docker container that runs the process. Whilst the process is running, you can go to [localhost:49160](http://localhost:49160) and see a simple but cool web interface that welcomes you to the Green Square Wizard.
